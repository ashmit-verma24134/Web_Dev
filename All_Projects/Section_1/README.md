Project Description:

This is a simple HTML webpage titled "Best Movies According to Ashmit". It displays a personal list of favorite movies with brief reasons for each choice. The page uses basic HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and line breaks to present the content clearly and is a great example of a beginner-level project to practice HTML structure and formatting.
