HTML Document Structure
This project is a beginner-level HTML webpage that serves as a birthday invitation. It uses basic HTML elements to structure the content in a clear and engaging way. The `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` heading tags are used to display the main title, date, and subheadings. An image of a birthday cake is embedded using the `<img>` tag with a `src` attribute linking to an external URL. The invitation lists what guests should bring using an unordered list (`<ul>`) with individual list items (`<li>`), making the content organized and easy to read. A hyperlink is added using the `<a>` tag, which leads to a Google Maps location for the party. The project demonstrates an understanding of web structure, content hierarchy, media embedding, list creation, and link navigation. It is a fun and practical introduction to building simple webpages using pure HTML.
